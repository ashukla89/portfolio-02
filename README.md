# Worldwide Patents By Country

This repository contains data and Python code (in a Jupyter Notebook, i.e. a .ipynb file) to support the findings published at ashukla89.github.io/portfolio-02/, which reveals the explosive growth of patent filings worldwide since 1980, and their relative concentration around the Pacific Rim.

## Data

The data was downloaded directly from a Harvard Dataverse site in .txt format from here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/OTTBDX. This dataset was collected by a team of Swiss economists whose research and data-collection methodology can be accessed from this link.

## Methodology / Code / Findings

Essentially, the analysis as presented represents the results of two analytical choices:
* Resolving patent filings by year and country/ state of origin.
* Grouping countries/ states by relatively arbitrary criteria into 12 groupings of countries and 11 groupings of US states.

Beyond that, the aggregation function is simply a count of patent files.

The analysis is available in the attached Jupyter notebook (patents.ipynb).
